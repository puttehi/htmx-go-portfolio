##### Overview

Did you want to customize your [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) blogs code highlighting outside of the pre-made themes?

Did you notice that it's hard to know what CSS class you should be using for what language to get the desired results?

Did you find out there's a bunch of Chroma token names that map to who-knows-what CSS class names?

Did you manage to write some sort of XML already but have no idea how to map it into CSS?

Time for a tool to help with the process :)

##### Features

- Render every supported language in a single HTML page to see what your styles look like
  - (as well as getting every possible class you can even encounter in the single page)
- Dump all the Chroma XML entry->CSS class name entries
- Generate a CSS file ready to ship

##### Languages

- Go
- XML
- CSS
